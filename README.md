# Cat-or-Dog-Prediction-Using-CNN
In this project we are looking forward to Predict Cat or Dog using CNN i.e Convolutional Neural Network

In this Project It is divided into several parts given below

Part-1: Data Preprocessing: 
In this part we are Preprocessing the Training set and Test set.

Part-2: Building CNN: 
In this part we are performing several stages which are listed below
1) Intialising the CNN using tensorflow keras module
2) Convulation
3) Pooling
4) Flattening
5) Full connection
6) Output Layer

Part-3: Training the CNN: 
In this part we are training using 'adam' optimizer , loss function 'binary cross entropy' , and for measuring performance we are using "Accuracy metric".
We are performing 25 epochs because data set is too large and after training the Accuracy is around 80%.


Part-4: Making single prediction: 
In this part we are making single prediction by using single image of Cat and Dog and my model is predicting and giving correct output by predicting Cat as cat and Dog as dog.
